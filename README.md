# IAR-STM32F4xx-Mixed_C-Asm
This can be loaded into a IAR Embedded Workbench targeting STM32F4xx project.  The program sorts any time of array using a variation of C style generics.
It is different in that it usings words as arguments as either an numeric or pointer value.  For more convention C-style generic programming, see C-Algorithms-Array-Interface repo.
For C++ generic programming, see CPP-No-Bloat-STM32F4xx repo.
